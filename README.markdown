Project structure
=================
The directory contains some configuration files for Eclipse and its PyDev plugin which are used to develop the project.

The unit tests related to a certain source file are placed inside `test` directory which is placed in the same directory as the source file. This is because we want the tests to be placed close to the source files but at the same time we want them to not pollute the source files directory.
